# **Supplicating To The Dead Is Shirk**

## Introduction

All praise is due to Allaah, the lord of the worlds. And may peace and blessings of Allaah be upon his messenger *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)*.

This post will be, *In Saa` Allaah*, a proof that all supplication is due to Allaah alone, and a refutation against those who say that supplication to the dead, **even if it be taking them as intermediaries**, is *Shirk* (polytheism / taking partners) with Allaah, giving evidences from The Qur'aan and the Sunnah, as well as evidence from the Sahaabah, their students, and their student's students, whom the messenger of Allaah *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)* said are the best of generations (see Saheeh Muslim, *Hadeeth* 2536).
