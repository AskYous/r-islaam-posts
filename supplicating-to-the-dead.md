# **Supplicating To The Dead Is Shirk**

## 1. Introduction

All praise is due to Allaah, the lord of the worlds. And may peace and blessings of Allaah be upon his messenger *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)*.

This post will be, *In Saa` Allaah*, a proof that all supplication is due to Allaah alone, and a refutation against those who say that supplication to the dead, **even if it be taking them as intermediaries**, is *Shirk* (polytheism / taking partners) with Allaah, giving evidences from The Qur'aan and the Sunnah, as well as evidence from the Sahaabah, their students, and their student's students, whom the messenger of Allaah *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)* said are the best of generations (see Saheeh Muslim, *Hadeeth* 2536), and the later scholars.

## 2. Evidence from the Qur'aan

### 2.1 Allaah Says we Ask Him Alone for help

> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ

> You (Alone) we worship, and **you (Alone) we ask for help** (for each and everything). - Soorat Al-Faatihah (1:5)

Here, Allaah gives the Muslims a prayer they say to Allaah, which includes **"You alone do we worship, and you alone do we ask for help."** And the words that indicate that Allaah alone is worshipped and asked for help is the Arabic used in the quoted verse, which is "Iyyaaka", which means "You alone". Similarly, Allaah says to the children of Israel **"[A]nd fear Me and Me (Ar. Iyaayaa) Alone"** - (Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:41)). Allaah also says "**O My slaves who believe! Certainly, spacious is My earth. Therefore worship Me (Ar. Iyaayaa) (Alone)."** So how can you permit asking the dead for help when Allaah clearly states that we ask him **alone** for help?
