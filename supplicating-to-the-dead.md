# **Supplicating To The Dead Is Shirk**

## 1. Introduction

All praise is due to Allaah, the lord of the worlds. And may peace and blessings of Allaah be upon his messenger *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)*.

This post will be, *In Saa` Allaah*, a proof that all supplication is due to Allaah alone, and a refutation against those who say that supplication to the dead, **even if it be taking them as intermediaries**, is *Shirk* (polytheism / taking partners) with Allaah, giving evidences from The Qur'aan and the authentic Sunnah.

## 2. Evidence from the Qur'aan

### 2.1 Allaah's Statement Regarding Asking Him Alone for Help

> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ

> You (Alone) we worship, and **you (Alone) we ask for help** (for each and everything). - Soorat Al-Faatihah (1:5)

Here, Allaah gives the Muslims a prayer they say to Allaah, which includes **"You alone do we worship, and you alone do we ask for help."** And the words that indicate that Allaah alone is worshipped and asked for help is the Arabic used in the quoted verse, which is "Iyyaaka", which means "You alone". Similarly, Allaah says to the children of Israel **"[A]nd fear Me and Me [Iyaayaa] Alone"** - (Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:41)). Allaah also says "**O My slaves who believe! Certainly, spacious is My earth. Therefore worship Me [Iyaayaa] (Alone)."** So how can you permit asking the dead for help when Allaah clearly states that we ask him **alone** for help?

### 2.2 Allaah's Statement Regarding The Prohibition of Calling Upon Anyone Besides Allaah

> وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا

> And the mosques are for Allaah (Alone), **so invoke not anyone along with Allaah**. - Soorat Al-Jinn (72:18)

Here, Allaah reveals to His messenger *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)* that the *Masaajid* (Mosques) are for Allaah, and to **not call with Allaah anyone else**. So this means that if anyone supplicates to anyone other than Allaah, then they are making the Mosque for other than Allaah. Look how Allaah puts these two in the same sentence. First, Allaah says that the *Masaajid* are for Allaah alone. Then he decudes from that (with His word "Fa", which means "so", which means the following is deduced from the previous statement), that we shouldn't call upon anyone other than Allaah. This means calling upon anyone besides Allaah is making the Mosque for someone besides Allaah.

### 2.3 Allaah's Invitation to Call Upon Him and His Promise of a Response

> وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ

> And your Lord said: "**Invoke Me**, [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism)] (and ask Me for anything) **I will respond** to your (invocation). - Soorat Ghaafir (40:60)

Here, Allaah quoted Himself inviting His servants to call upon Him. After this invitation, He promises that He will respond. And Allaah never breaks His promise. So why call upon other than Allaah if Allaah invites us to call upon Him? Is it that He will not respond to us? How can one say such a statement when Allaah said **"I will respond"**?

## 3. Evidence from the Sunnaah

## 3.1 Allaah's Messenger ‏‏Advising Not To Ask Anyone For Anything

> "‏ مَنْ تَكَفَّلَ لِي أَنْ لاَ يَسْأَلَ النَّاسَ شَيْئًا وَأَتَكَفَّلَ لَهُ بِالْجَنَّةِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ثَوْبَانُ أَنَا ‏.‏ فَكَانَ لاَ يَسْأَلُ أَحَدًا شَيْئًا"

> Whoever guarantee  me that he will not ask the people for anything, I guarantee him paradise. - Sunan Abee Dawood (1643). Rated authentic by Al-Albaanee

And the *Hadeeth* ends with the narrator of the *Hadeeth* and *Sahaabah* (companion) of the messenger of Allaah *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)* not asking anyone for anything.

## 3.2 Allaah's Messenger Advising To Ask Only Allaah

> إِذَا سَأَلْتَ فَاسْأَلِ اللَّهَ وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْتَ فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللَّهِ

> When you ask, ask Allaah, and when you seek aid, seek Allaah's aid. - Sunan at-Tirmidhee (*Hadeeth* 2516). Rated authentic by at-Tirmidhee.

These two *Ahadeeth* from the messenger of Allaah *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)* are extremely clear. The first, he advises to not ask anyone for anything. So why ask those who are dead for anything, including intercession, when the messenger of Allaah *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)* **guaranteed** paradise to the one who does not ask **anyone** for **anything**? If a person wanted to be guaranteed paradise, then he should stay away from asking the dead for help. And the latter narration is advice to ask Allaah directly! As he *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)* said: **"When you ask, ask Allaah."**

## 3.3 Allaah's Messenger Informing That Supplication is *Shirk* (Polytheism)

> الدُّعَاءُ هُوَ الْعِبَادَةُ ‏{‏ قَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ ‏}

> Supplication (du'a') is itself the worship. (He then recited:) "And your Lord said: Call on Me, I will answer you" (xI.60). - Sunan Abee Dawood (1479). Rated authentic by Al-Albaanee

This *Hadeeth* is crystal clear. The supplication is itself worship. This means that when one calls upon Allaah, that calling worshipping Allaah. And it also means that when one calls upon the dead, that call is worshipping the dead, because he *(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam)* said: **Supplication (du'a') is itself the worship.** Then he recited the verse in Soorat al-A'raaf in which Allaah invites His servants to call upon him. How clear is this narration... and here come the Soofees and the Shee'ahs saying to call upon saints and their Imaams.
