# [2.3] SECTION 3: Refutation of those who deny the Names and Attributes (of Allah) or deny a part thereof.

Those who deny the Attributes of Allah are of three classes:

1. **The Jahmiyyah**: These are the followers of Jahm bin Safwan. These people deny all the Names of Attributes (of Allah).
2. **The Mu'tazilah**: They are the followers of Wasil bin Ata' who dissociated himself from the sitting of Hasan Al-Basri. These people affirmed the Names (of Allah), with the implication that they are wordings alone, devoid of meanings, and they deny all (His) Attributes
3. **The Ashaa'irah, Al-Maturidiyyah and those who follow them**: These people affirm the Names and some Attributes and negate some (Attributes).

The confusion upon which they all based their opinions, is an attempt to flee from comparing Allah to His creatures (according to their thinking), because some creatures are also referred to with some of these Names and are described with some of these Attributes. Therefore, if there is similarity in the wordings of the Names and Attributes, and their meanings, their realities must necessarily be the same (according to them). This necessitates likening the creature with the Creator in their opinion. SO they chose to confront this in one of two ways.

**a.** Either by twitsting the texts (or Qur'an and Sunnah) establishing the Names and Attributes (of Allah) away from their apparent meanings, such as interpreting the Face to mean self and the Hand to mean bounty.

**b.** Or resigning the meaning of these texts (or Qur'an and Sunnah) to Allah. So, they say *'Allah Alone those the intent thereof,'* believing that its apparent meaning is not the intent.

The first people known to have denied the Names and Attribute (of Allah) are some Arab Idolaters, about whom Allah - the Most High - said:

> **كَذَٰلِكَ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ فِي أُمَّةٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهَا أُمَمٌ لِّتَتْلُوَ عَلَيْهِمُ الَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِالرَّحْمَٰنِ ۚ قُلْ هُوَ رَبِّي لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ مَتَابِ**

> **"Thus have We sent you (O Muhammad SAW) to a community before whom other communities have passed away, in order that you might recite unto them what We have inspired to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Beneficient (Allah) Say: "He is my Lord! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He)! In Him is my trust, and to Him will be my return with repentance." "** - Soorat ar-Ra'd (13:30)

The reason for the revelation of this verse was that when the *Quraysh* tribe heard the Messenger of Allah mentioning *Ar-Raman* (the Most Gracious), they disputed it and so Allah revealed about them: **"...while they disblieve in The Most Gracious (Allah)."**

Ibn Jarir mentioned that this occurrence was during the Treaty of *Hudaybiyyah;* when the scribe wrote in the truce between them *(Quraysh)* and the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) *'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.'*

The *Quraysh* said: *'As for ar-Rahman (The Most Gracious), we know Him not.'*

Anso, Ibn Jarir narrated from Ibn 'Abbas: *'The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate while in prostration (saying): "O Rahman (Most Gracious), O Rahim (Most Merciful)."* So, the idolaters said: *"So, he thinks he is invoking only one while he mentions two!"* So, Allah revealed:

> **قُلِ ادْعُوا اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُوا الرَّحْمَٰنَ ۖ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُوا فَلَهُ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ ۚ وَلَا تَجْهَرْ بِصَلَاتِكَ وَلَا تُخَافِتْ بِهَا وَابْتَغِ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا**

> **"Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Invoke Allah or invoke the Most Beneficent (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names. And offer your Salat (prayer) neither aloud nor in a low voice, but follow a way between."** - Soorat Al-Israa' (17:110)

Allah - the Most High - said in *Surat-ul-Furqan:*

> **وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ اسْجُدُوا لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ قَالُوا وَمَا الرَّحْمَٰنُ**

> "And when it is said to them: "Prostrate to the Most Beneficent (Allah)! They say: "And what is the Most Beneficent?..." - Soorat al-Furqaan (25:60)

These polytheists are the predecessors (fore-runners) of the *Jaymiyyah*, *Mu'tazilah*, *Asha'irah*, and anyone who denies what Allah has affirmed for Himself and what His messenger (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) has affirmed for Him of Names and Attributes. What a despicable predecessor for a despicable successor?!

Their refutation is from several perspectives:

1. Allah, Glorified and Most High, affirmed these Names and Attributes amongst creatures or the existence of some creatures known by these Names, that there be any similarity between Allah and His creatures. Allah, Glorified is He, has Names and Attributes, which are specific to Him and creatures have names and attributes, which are specific to them. Just as Allah, Glorified and Most High, has a Self that is not similar to those of created beings, He also has Names and Attributes that are not similar to their names and attributes. Similarity in name and general meaning does not necessitate similarity in reality. Allah called himself *'Alim* (the All-Knower) and called on of His slaves *'Alim* (knowledgeable). He said:

> **فَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً ۖ قَالُوا لَا تَخَفْ ۖ وَبَشَّرُوهُ بِغُلَامٍ عَلِيمٍ**

> **"Then he conceived a fear of them (when they ate not). They said: "Fear not." And they gave him glad tidings of an intelligent son, having knowledge (about Allah and His religion of True Monotheism)."** - Soorat adh-Dhaariyaat (51:28)

That is, Ishaq (Isaac). He also called another *Halim* (forbearing). He said:

> **فَبَشَّرْنَاهُ بِغُلَامٍ حَلِيمٍ**

> **"So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy."** - Soorat ass-Saaffaat (37:101)

That is, Ismail. However, a knowledgeable one is not similar to the other, nor is a forbearing one similar to another. He also called Himself saying:

> **إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا**

> **"Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer."** - Soorat an-Nisaa' (4:58)

And He called some of His slaves hearer and seer. He said:

> **إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا الْإِنسَانَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ نَّبْتَلِيهِ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا**

>**"Verily, We have created man from Nutfah drops of mixed semen (discharge of man and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer, seer."** - Soorat al-Insaan (76:2)

But one hearer is not similar to the other, nor is one seer, comparable to the other. He also called Himself the Kind and the Merciful saying:

> **إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ**

> **"Verily, Allah is, for mankind, full of Kindness, Most Merciful."** - Soorat al-Hajj

And He called one of His creatures kind and merciful saying:

> **وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ**

> **"And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills"** - Soorat al-Baqarah (2:255)
