# [2.3] SECTION 3: Refutation of those who deny the Names and Attributes (of Allah) or deny a part thereof.

Those who deny the Attributes of Allah are of three classes:

1. **The Jahmiyyah**: These are the followers of Jahm bin Safwan. These people deny all the Names of Attributes (of Allah).
2. **The Mu'tazilah**: They are the followers of Wasil bin Ata' who dissociated himself from the sitting of Hasan Al-Basri. These people affirmed the Names (of Allah), with the implication that they are wordings alone, devoid of meanings, and they deny all (His) Attributes
3. **The Ashaa'irah, Al-Maturidiyyah and those who follow them**: These people affirm the Names and some Attributes and negate some (Attributes).

The confusion upon which they all based their opinions, is an attempt to flee from comparing Allah to His creatures (according to their thinking), because some creatures are also referred to with some of these Names and are described with some of these Attributes. Therefore, if there is similarity in the wordings of the Names and Attributes, and their meanings, their realities must necessarily be the same (according to them). This necessitates likening the creature with the Creator in their opinion. SO they chose to confront this in one of two ways.

**a.** Either by twitsting the texts (or Qur'an and Sunnah) establishing the Names and Attributes (of Allah) away from their apparent meanings, such as interpreting the Face to mean self and the Hand to mean bounty.

**b.** Or resigning the meaning of these texts (or Qur'an and Sunnah) to Allah. So, they say *'Allah Alone those the intent thereof,'* believing that its apparent meaning is not the intent.

The first people known to have denied the Names and Attribute (of Allah) are some Arab Idolaters, about whom Allah - the Most High - said:

> **كَذَٰلِكَ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ فِي أُمَّةٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهَا أُمَمٌ لِّتَتْلُوَ عَلَيْهِمُ الَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِالرَّحْمَٰنِ ۚ قُلْ هُوَ رَبِّي لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ مَتَابِ**

> **"Thus have We sent you (O Muhammad SAW) to a community before whom other communities have passed away, in order that you might recite unto them what We have inspired to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Beneficient (Allah) Say: "He is my Lord! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He)! In Him is my trust, and to Him will be my return with repentance." "** - Soorat ar-Ra'd (13:30)

The reason for the revelation of this verse was that when the *Quraysh* tribe heard the Messenger of Allah mentioning *Ar-Raman* (the Most Gracious), they disputed it and so Allah revealed about them: **"...while they disblieve in The Most Gracious (Allah)."**

Ibn Jarir mentioned that this occurrence was during the Treaty of *Hudaybiyyah;* when the scribe wrote in the truce between them *(Quraysh)* and the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) *'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.'*

The *Quraysh* said: *'As for ar-Rahman (The Most Gracious), we know Him not.'*

Anso, Ibn Jarir narrated from Ibn 'Abbas: *'The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate while in prostration (saying): "O Rahman (Most Gracious), O Rahim (Most Merciful)."* So, the idolaters said: *"So, he thinks he is invoking only one while he mentions two!"* So, Allah revealed:

> **قُلِ ادْعُوا اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُوا الرَّحْمَٰنَ ۖ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُوا فَلَهُ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ ۚ وَلَا تَجْهَرْ بِصَلَاتِكَ وَلَا تُخَافِتْ بِهَا وَابْتَغِ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا**

> **"Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Invoke Allah or invoke the Most Beneficent (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names. And offer your Salat (prayer) neither aloud nor in a low voice, but follow a way between."** - Soorat Al-Israa' (17:110)

Allah - the Most High - said in *Surat-ul-Furqan:*

> **وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ اسْجُدُوا لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ قَالُوا وَمَا الرَّحْمَٰنُ**

> "And when it is said to them: "Prostrate to the Most Beneficent (Allah)! They say: "And what is the Most Beneficent?..." - Soorat al-Furqaan (25:60)

These polytheists are the predecessors (fore-runners) of the *Jaymiyyah*, *Mu'tazilah*, *Asha'irah*, and anyone who denies what Allah has affirmed for Himself and what His messenger (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) has affirmed for Him of Names and Attributes. What a despicable predecessor for a despicable successor?!

Their refutation is from several perspectives:

**1.** Allah, Glorified and Most High, affirmed these Names and Attributes for Himself, and His messenger affirmed them for Him. So, denying them or part of them is a denial of what Allah and His messenger have affirmed. This is opposition to Allah and His messenger (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam).

**2.** It is not necessary that by the existence of these Attributes amongst creatures or the existence of some creatures known by these Names, that there be any similarity between Allah and His creatures. Allah, Glorified is He, has Names and Attributes, which are specific to Him and creatures have names and attributes, which are specific to them. Just as Allah, Glorified and Most High, has a Self that is not similar to those of created beings, He also has Names and Attributes that are not similar to their names and attributes. Similarity in name and general meaning does not necessitate similarity in reality. Allah called himself *'Alim* (the All-Knower) and called on of His slaves *'Alim* (knowledgeable). He said:

> **فَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً ۖ قَالُوا لَا تَخَفْ ۖ وَبَشَّرُوهُ بِغُلَامٍ عَلِيمٍ**

> **"Then he conceived a fear of them (when they ate not). They said: "Fear not." And they gave him glad tidings of an intelligent son, having knowledge (about Allah and His religion of True Monotheism)."** - Soorat adh-Dhaariyaat (51:28)

That is, Ishaq (Isaac). He also called another *Halim* (forbearing). He said:

> **فَبَشَّرْنَاهُ بِغُلَامٍ حَلِيمٍ**

> **"So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy."** - Soorat ass-Saaffaat (37:101)

That is, Ismail. However, a knowledgeable one is not similar to the other, nor is a forbearing one similar to another. He also called Himself saying:

> **إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا**

> **"Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer."** - Soorat an-Nisaa' (4:58)

And He called some of His slaves hearer and seer. He said:

> **إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا الْإِنسَانَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ نَّبْتَلِيهِ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا**

>**"Verily, We have created man from Nutfah drops of mixed semen (discharge of man and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer, seer."** - Soorat al-Insaan (76:2)

But one hearer is not similar to the other, nor is one seer, comparable to the other. He also called Himself the Kind and the Merciful saying:

> **إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ**

> **"Verily, Allah is, for mankind, full of Kindness, Most Merciful."** - Soorat al-Hajj

And He called one of His creatures kind and merciful saying:

> **وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ**

> **"And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills"** - Soorat al-Baqarah (2:255)

So He described Himself with knowledge. He also described His creatures with knowledge, saying:

> **"وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ ۖ قُلِ الرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي وَمَا أُوتِيتُم مِّنَ الْعِلْمِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا"**

> **"And they ask you (O Muhammad SAW) concerning the Ruh (the Spirit); Say: "The Ruh (the Spirit): it is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little."** - Soorat al-Israa (17:85)

He also said:

> **وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ**

> **"[B]ut over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allah)."** -  Soorat Yusuf (12:76)

He also said:

> **وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ **

> **"But those who had been given (religious) knowledge said..."** - Soorat al-Qasas (28:80)

He also described himself with Power saying:

> **اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةً ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفًا وَشَيْبَةً**

> **"Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair."** - Soorat ar-Room (30:54)

...and so on. It is known that the Names and Attributes of Allah are specific to Him and are according to what befits Him, while the names and attributes of creatures are specific to them and are according to what befits them. It is not necessary that similarity in wordings and meanings should imply similarity in reality (true nature). This is due to the lack of comparability between the two. This is obvious , and al praise be to Allah.

**3.** One who does not possess Perfect Attributes is not fit to be the God of the universe. This is why Ibrahim said to his father:

> **لِمَ تَعْبُدُ مَا لَا يَسْمَعُ وَلَا يُبْصِرُ**

> **"Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not..."** - Soorat Maryum (19:42)

Also, He - the Most High - said, while refuting those who worshipped the Calf:

> **أَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّهُ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمْ وَلَا يَهْدِيهِمْ سَبِيلًا**

> **"Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the way?"** - Soorat al-A'raaf (7:148)

**4.** The affirmation of Attributes is a sign of perfection, while its negation is a defect. One who possesses no attributes is either non-existent or defective, and Allah is free of such.

**5. ** There is no evience for the interpretation of these Attributes away from their apparent meanings. So, such interpretations are invalid. Also, resigning the meaning thereof (to Allah), necessitates that Allah addressed us in the Qur'an with that which we understant not its meaning, despite His ordering us to invoke Him by His names. How can we invoke Him with what we understand not? He also commanded us to ponder over all His verses; so, how do we ponder over what cannot be understood?

It becomes clear that this that the names and Attributes of Allah must be affirmed in a way that befits Allah; negating any similarity (in its real essence) with those of creatures as Allah - the most High - said:

> **لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ**

> **"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer."** - Soorat Ash-Shooraa (42:11)
